                <p>Having created and used pairing matrix visualization creator for the quite sometime, Based on the observations and feedback 
I did some enhancements</p>

<ul>
<li> Coloring of contributor icons (circles)</li>
<li> Positioning any contributor icon around the ring by click and drag</li>
<li> Merging duplicate contributor names by click, drag and drop over another icon</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy visualizing!
